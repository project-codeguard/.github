# Project CodeGuard

[Project CodeGuard](https://github.com/project-codeguard/rules) is an open-source, model-agnostic security framework that embeds secure-by-default practices into AI coding agent workflows. It provides comprehensive security rules that guide AI assistants to generate more secure code automatically.

## Why Project CodeGuard?

AI coding agents are transforming software engineering, but this speed can introduce security vulnerabilities. Is your AI coding agent implementation introducing security vulnerabilities?

[Project CodeGuard](https://github.com/project-codeguard/rules) solves this by embedding security best practices directly into AI coding agent workflows. It supports agent skills and rules that can be used in most coding agent platforms to make this happen.
